  abstract  = "In our changing world, understanding plant community responses to
               global change drivers is critical for predicting future ecosystem
               composition and function. Plant functional traits promise to be a
               key predictive tool for many ecosystems, including grasslands;
               however, their use requires both complete plant community and
               functional trait data. Yet, representation of these data in
               global databases is sparse, particularly beyond a handful of most
               used traits and common species. Here we present the CoRRE Trait
               Data, spanning 17 traits (9 categorical, 8 continuous)
               anticipated to predict species' responses to global change for
               4,079 vascular plant species across 173 plant families present in
               390 grassland experiments from around the world. The dataset
               contains complete categorical trait records for all 4,079 plant
               species obtained from a comprehensive literature search, as well
               as nearly complete coverage (99.97\%) of imputed continuous trait
               values for a subset of 2,927 plant species. These data will shed
               light on mechanisms underlying population, community, and
               ecosystem responses to global change in grasslands worldwide.",

   abstract = {Susceptibility to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita in plants is thought to be a complex trait based on multiple genes involved in cell differentiation, growth and defence. Previous genetic analyses of susceptibility to M. incognita have mainly focused on segregating dominant resistance genes in crops. It is not known if plants harbour significant genetic variation in susceptibility to M. incognita independent of dominant resistance. To study the genetic architecture of susceptibility to M. incognita, we analysed nematode reproduction on a highly diverse set of 340 natural inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana with genome-wide association mapping. We observed a surprisingly large variation in nematode reproduction among these lines. Genome-wide association mapping revealed four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) located on chromosomes 1 and 5 of A. thaliana significantly associated with reproductive success of M. incognita, none of which harbours typical resistance gene homologues. Mutant analysis of three genes located in two QTLs showed that the transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 and an F-box family protein may function as (co-)regulators of susceptibility to M. incognita in Arabidopsis. Our data suggest that breeding for loss-of-susceptibility, based on allelic variants critically involved in nematode feeding, could be used to make crops more resilient to root-knot nematodes.},

abstract = {Summary The aim of this review was to undertake a survey of researchers working with plant-parasitic nematodes in order to determine a ‘top 10’ list of these pathogens based on scientific and economic importance. Any such list will not be definitive as economic importance will vary depending on the region of the world in which a researcher is based. However, care was taken to include researchers from as many parts of the world as possible when carrying out the survey. The top 10 list emerging from the survey is composed of: (1) root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.); (2) cyst nematodes (Heterodera and Globodera spp.); (3) root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.); (4) the burrowing nematode Radopholus similis; (5) Ditylenchus dipsaci; (6) the pine wilt nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus; (7) the reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis; (8) Xiphinema index (the only virus vector nematode to make the list); (9) Nacobbus aberrans; and (10) Aphelenchoides besseyi. The biology of each nematode (or nematode group) is reviewed briefly.},

    abstract = "{Nematode migration, feeding site formation, withdrawal of plant assimilates, and activation of plant defence responses have a significant impact on plant growth and development. Plants display intraspecific variation in tolerance limits for root-feeding nematodes. Although disease tolerance has been recognised as a distinct trait in biotic interactions of mainly crops, we lack mechanistic insights. Progress is hampered by difficulties in quantification and laborious screening methods. We turned to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, since it offers extensive resources to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying nematode-plant interactions. Through imaging of tolerance-related parameters the green canopy area was identified as an accessible and robust measure for assessing damage due to cyst nematode infection. Subsequently, a high-throughput phenotyping platform simultaneously measuring the green canopy area growth of 960 A. thaliana plants was developed. This platform can accurately measure cyst- and root-knot nematode tolerance limits in A. thaliana through classical modelling of tolerance limits. Furthermore, real-time monitoring provided data for a novel view of tolerance, identifying a compensatory growth response. These findings show that our phenotyping platform will enable further studies into a mechanistic understanding of tolerance to below-ground biotic stress.}",
