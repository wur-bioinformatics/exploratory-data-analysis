  abstract  = "In our changing world, understanding plant community responses to
               global change drivers is critical for predicting future ecosystem
               composition and function. Plant functional traits promise to be a
               key predictive tool for many ecosystems, including grasslands;
               however, their use requires both complete plant community and
               functional trait data. Yet, representation of these data in
               global databases is sparse, particularly beyond a handful of most
               used traits and common species. Here we present the CoRRE Trait
               Data, spanning 17 traits (9 categorical, 8 continuous)
               anticipated to predict species' responses to global change for
               4,079 vascular plant species across 173 plant families present in
               390 grassland experiments from around the world. The dataset
               contains complete categorical trait records for all 4,079 plant
               species obtained from a comprehensive literature search, as well
               as nearly complete coverage (99.97\%) of imputed continuous trait
               values for a subset of 2,927 plant species. These data will shed
               light on mechanisms underlying population, community, and
               ecosystem responses to global change in grasslands worldwide.",
