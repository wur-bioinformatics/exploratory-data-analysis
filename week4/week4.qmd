## The goals for week 4

In this final week, we will consolidate a lot of what was learnt in the first three weeks, with the emphasis on increasing your confidence in writing your own R code to solve data-related issues. 

The learning objectives of week 4 are:

1.  Apply data science competences to write your own R code to solve data analytic tasks
2.  Understand common sources of error in data, and apply approaches to deal with these errors
3.  Understand the importance of colour choice for visualisations of different types of data
4.  Apply data science competences to reproduce publication-quality data visualisations
5.  Apply string operations for character string manipulation



## How week 4 is organised

Similar to previous weeks, the first three days are intended to work through these objectives, while Thursday is kept for code peer-review and exam preparation, and Friday (morning) the exam. As before, there is an assignment due on Wednesday evening (23:59), which forms the basis of the peer-review exercise on Thursday. 

The content of the first three days is as follows:

-   **Monday**: Dealing with errors and outliers

-   **Tuesday**: Exploring genetic and phenotypic diversity in *Arabidopsis thaliana*

-   **Wednesday**: (if needed) Completion of the data analysis from Tuesday / String operations and data parsing
