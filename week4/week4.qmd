# IV: Advanced techniques

In this final week, we will consolidate a lot of what was learnt in the first 3 weeks, with the emphasis on increasing your confidence in writing R code to solve data-related issues. 
The structure of the week is dataset-driven:

-   **Monday** (day 1): Exploring genetic and phenotypic diversity in *Arabidopsis thaliana*

-   **Tuesday** (day 2): Using simulations to develop data analysis competences

-   **Wednesday** (day 3): *to be decided..*

-   **Thursday** (day 4): Code-a-thon with your peers ;)

-   **Friday** (day 5): Conclusion of the course, Assessment

There are separate chapters for each of the first 3 days.
