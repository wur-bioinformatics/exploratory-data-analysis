# Week 4, advanced techniques

In this final week, we will consolidate a lot of what was learnt in the first 3 weeks, with the emphasis on increasing your confidence in writing R code to solve data-related issues. The structure of the week is dataset-driven:

-   **Monday** (day 1): Exploring genetic and phenotypic diversity in *Arabidopsis thaliana*

-   **Tuesday** (day 2): Using simulations to develop data analysis competences

-   **Wednesday** (day 3): *to be decided..*

-   **Thursday** (day 4): Code-a-thon with your peers ;)

-   **Friday** (day 5): Conclusion of the course, Assessment

## Day 1: Exploring genetic and phenotypic diversity in *Arabidopsis thaliana*

Intro...

## Big data in R

R is not famed for its capacities to deal with big data. In R, "big" usually means taking up lots of working memory. For example, if we try to allocate a very large vector within R, at some point we will get an error message (on my computer this occurs for i = 10 in the following call):

```{r}
#| error: true

for(i in 1:10){
  t <- system.time(temp <- rep("memorytest",10^i))
  message(paste0("A vector with 10^",i," elements takes ",round(t[3],1)," seconds to generate and store."))  
  cat("____________________________________________________________________\n")
}
```
