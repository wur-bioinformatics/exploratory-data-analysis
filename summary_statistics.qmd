## Summary statistics

Let's load an example data set and look at how some summary statistics can be computed.

Conventional way first.

```{r}
library(datasets)
dataset(iris)
head(iris)
```

`dim` lets us inspect the size of the data.

```{r}
dim(iris)
```

`summary` gives a per-column overview: mean, median, quartiles, and min/max values for numeric columns, counts for factors.

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

Alternative one-liner syntax that does not bring anything unnecessary in scope and uses the pipe operator. 

```{r}
datasets::iris |> summary()
```
